                <div class="section">
                    <h3>1. The trigger (when it all goes to shit)</h3>
                    <p>In proyect stardust, 20 minutes is a long time. If the system detects a 3+ player difference for more than 60 seconds (giving people time to rejoin if they crashed), the CONTRACT opens. It does not just grab a random person; it sends a popup to the winning team.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>2. The rewards (why you would actually do it)</h3>
                    <p>This is where the "I’m losing my rewards" objection gets fixed. If you accept the contract and swap sides, you receive Mercenary Status:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Faction loyalty (grind protector)</strong> - You keep progressing the faction you want. If you entered the match as a Rebel to advance that Tier V MC-85, all XP and credits you earn while playing for the Empire still count toward your Rebel progress.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hazard pay multiplier</strong> - Because we do not want players swapping and then idling for a free win bonus, you are not simply handed the win. Instead, you get a 1.5x multiplier on everything you do after swapping. If you perform exceptionally and carry the losing team, you will earn far more than if you had stayed on the winning side.</li>
                        <li><strong>Score retention</strong> - Your total damage and kills remain on the board. No reset to zero.</li>
                        <li><strong>Win bonus safety net</strong> - If you swap and the team still loses, you still receive the "Contract Completion" bonus, equal to a standard win bonus. You are paid for the attempt, not just the result.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>3. Solving the --skill gap-- and --forced swap-- problems</h3>
                    <p>Problem: If we force the worst player to swap, they will get farmed harder. If we force the best player, they will be upset because they were performing well.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>top scorer protection.</strong> The top three players on the winning team are never forced to swap. They earned their dominance; let them keep it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Selective draft.</strong> If no one volunteers after 30 seconds, the system picks from the middle of the scoreboard. These are players who are contributing but are not currently on a record-breaking run.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier aware handling.</strong> In a Tier III/V (8v8), one strong player swapping can change the entire match. In a Tier I/II (12v12), the system may move two people at once to address the imbalance.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>4. The "mercy" failsafes (choose your ending)</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes a match is simply too far gone. Even a mercenary can’t save a 2v8 spawncamp. There are two ways to end the suffering without robbing the winners of their achievement:</p>
                    
                    <h4>Option A: Mercy timer (passive)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the player gap is large and the score gap even larger (for example, winners have 3x more points), the match timer accelerates.</li>
                        <li>Instead of 10 minutes remaining, the clock runs 4x faster.</li>
                        <li>Why? It ends the match in two minutes instead of ten. The winners still get their complete victory, the losers escape the spawntrap sooner, and the server can reset and scramble teams for a fresh round.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- COLUMN 3 -->
            <div class="col">
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Option B: Extraction vote (active)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At the 10 minute mark, if a team is outnumbered and being crushed, they get a "Call for Extraction" vote.</li>
                        <li>If the losing team votes [Yes] the match ends instantly.</li>
                        <li>The winners receive full rewards (they effectively forced a surrender).</li>
                        <li>The losers keep their XP and are not penalised for leaving early.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">Note: Combine both. Apply the Mercy timer automatically, and if the losing side is still miserable they can vote for Extraction to end it even faster.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>5. Anti abuse</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No team-hopping.</strong> You cannot swap at will to farm Hazard Pay. The system only offers the contract when the server is actually dying.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ghost slot.</strong> If you ragequit a losing 4v8 and try to rejoin the same server to get on the winning 8 man team, the game recognises your UserID and forces you back into your original slot. No escaping the grind.</li>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>6. Summary (opinion)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tier I/II (12v12):</strong> Prioritise the mercenary contract, more bodies help balance play.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier III/V (8v8):</strong> Prioritise the mercy timer, skill gaps here are too influential for single swaps to reliably fix matches.</li>
                        <li><strong>bottom line:</strong> Do not punish the winners / incentivise them to help the losers.</li>
